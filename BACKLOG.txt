add a "not implemented" test failure type to allow tests to be defined
	without being implemented right away, or forgotten later
	report # of not implemented tests

add an option to "ignore tests until <date>"
	TESTPP( ... ) { ignore_until( 2009, 10, 11 ); }
	test automatically runs silently until Oct 11, 2009
	report # of "ignored/postponed" tests

fix the human output so it's easier to read

add tested scoping: private for live, public for tests

add test filter class, and have only a single implementation of testpp_set::run

add --ls-tests command line option

write tests for any code that doesn't have it yet

user documentation

make debian installable
	add deb command to the Makefile

json output writer

xml output writer

allow writing to multiple output formats at once

consider modifying test to optionally run tests externally to handle exceptions and errors
	potentially a standalone "runner" program that runs all tests individually
		as separate processes
	maybe multiple runner classes that either launch remotely, fork or something

support testing for memory leaks
	may require running in a special memory leak mode

integrate gcov for coverage analysis
