testpp is a lightweight, easy to use c++ testing framework.

It uses macros for the simplest cases, but doesn't hide a lot of complexity
behind the macros so it can be used without the macros.

Features:
* Easy to use
* Simple enough to be used without macros if desired
* Can run individual tests or suites from the command line
* Various output formats, user-definable
